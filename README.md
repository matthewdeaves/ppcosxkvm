# ppcosxkvm

**PowerPC Mac OS X Tiger on Apple Silicon, with real 3D.** A patched QEMU
emulates a Power Mac G4 with an **ATI Radeon 9700 PRO**. Tiger's own ATI
driver runs the emulated card, and the card's 3D engine is translated to
Metal on the host GPU. Quartz Extreme, Core Image and OpenGL work on the
emulated card.

System Profiler in the guest reports an **ATI Radeon 9700 Pro** (`ATY,R300`),
with Quartz Extreme and Core Image both *Supported*.

## Quick start

You need an Apple Silicon Mac, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and **your own**
Mac OS X Tiger (PowerPC) install DVD image or an already installed PowerPC
OS X disk.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewdeaves/ppcosxkvm.git
cd ppcosxkvm
./ppcosx setup
```

`setup` installs a few Homebrew packages and builds QEMU (about 5–10
minutes, once). Then either install Tiger from a DVD image:

```bash
./ppcosx install ~/Downloads/MacOSX-10.4-Tiger.iso
```

or bring a disk you already have (`.vmdk`, `.qcow2`, `.vdi`, `.vhd`, raw
`.img`, or a whole UTM `.utm` bundle):

```bash
./ppcosx import ~/VMs/Tiger.vmdk
```

and boot it:

```bash
./ppcosx run
```

`./ppcosx doctor` checks everything, and `./ppcosx help` lists all commands.

## Status

Verified on Tiger 10.4.11:

| Works | Notes |
|---|---|
| Desktop with Quartz Extreme | Window server compositing, window dragging, the Dock, QuickTime movies |
| Core Image | Reported as *Supported*; the R300 fragment programs it needs are implemented |
| OpenGL apps | Chess is the main test: depth, stencil, 2× MSAA, textures, picking |
| Hardware cursor, USB keyboard and mouse | |
| System Profiler shows "ATI Radeon 9700 Pro" | Works without an ATI ROM |

Expected to work but not re-tested since the move to `ppcosx`: networking
(NAT), sound, and **installing from a DVD image** (`ppcosx install` uses the
standard QEMU Tiger recipe; please open an issue if it fails for you).

**Not yet:** Leopard (untested), more than 1024×768 in the Radeon mode
(experimental; use `--res`), and multiple CPUs (the guest is a single G4 on
TCG, so expect a fast G4 rather than a G5). See the
[limitations](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md#limitations).
