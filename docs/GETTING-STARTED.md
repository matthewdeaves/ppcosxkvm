# Getting started

This walks through everything from a fresh clone to a Tiger desktop with 3D
acceleration. If something goes wrong, see
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 1. What you need

* **An Apple Silicon Mac** (M1 or later) on a recent macOS. Intel Macs
  aren't tested.
* **Homebrew**: <https://brew.sh>.
* **Xcode Command Line Tools.** `setup` starts the installer if they're
  missing. The full Xcode app isn't needed.
* **About 25 GB free**: roughly 1.5 GB for the QEMU build, plus the guest
  disk (it grows as you use it, 40 GB maximum by default).
* **Mac OS X for PowerPC**, which you provide. Either:
  * a **Tiger (10.4) install DVD image**: `.iso`, `.cdr`, `.dmg` or `.toast`.
    Use a *retail* DVD (black "X" or the 10.4 "Universal" DVD). The grey
    discs that shipped with a specific Mac often refuse to install on
    other models. **or**
  * an **already installed PowerPC OS X disk image** from another emulator,
    such as a UTM VM (`.utm`), VMware (`.vmdk`), VirtualBox (`.vdi`), or a raw
    `.img`/`.qcow2`.

For the best result, update the guest to **10.4.11** (the "Mac OS X 10.4.11
Combo Update (PPC)"). That's the version everything is tested on.

## 2. Get the code and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewdeaves/ppcosxkvm.git
cd ppcosxkvm
./ppcosx setup
```

Don't use `git clone --recursive`. It would also download QEMU's own nested
submodules (EDK2, OpenSSL and more, several GB) that this project doesn't
need. `setup` fetches just the QEMU fork.

`setup`:

1. checks that this is a Mac with the Command Line Tools and Homebrew,
2. `brew install`s `ninja pkgconf glib pixman libslirp` (only the missing ones),
3. fetches the QEMU fork into `qemu/` (a shallow git submodule, several
   hundred MB),
4. configures and builds `qemu-system-ppc` and `qemu-img` into `qemu/build/`.

The first build takes 5–10 minutes. Running `setup` again later is safe; it
only rebuilds what changed. Logs are in `qemu/build/ppcosx-*.log`.

## 3a. Install Tiger from a DVD image

```bash
./ppcosx install ~/Downloads/MacOSX-Tiger.iso
```

This creates an empty 40 GB disk at `vm/macosx.qcow2`, then boots the DVD in a
window. `--size 60G` picks a different size. A `.dmg` is first converted
once to a raw `.cdr` in `vm/`, because QEMU can't read compressed disk
images.

In the installer:

1. Choose a language and click through to the installer's first screen.
2. From the **Utilities** menu, open **Disk Utility**.
3. Select the **QEMU HARDDISK** in the list on the left, open the **Erase**
   tab, choose **Mac OS Extended (Journaled)**, name it (e.g. *Macintosh
   HD*), and click **Erase**.
4. Quit Disk Utility, and you're back in the installer. Continue, and pick
   the new volume.
5. Optional but much faster: click **Customize** and untick *Printer
   Drivers*, *Additional Fonts* and *Language Translations*.
6. Wait. A full install is roughly 30–60 minutes under emulation. The
   progress bar can sit still for minutes at a time, which is normal.
7. When the installer restarts the machine, the window closes (the
   installer runs with QEMU's `-no-reboot`).

The installer uses a plain framebuffer, not the Radeon. It doesn't need 3D,
and this is the configuration the Tiger installer is known to work with.

## 3b. …or bring an existing disk

```bash
./ppcosx import ~/VMs/Tiger.vmdk          # .vmdk .qcow2 .vdi .vhd .img
./ppcosx import ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents/Tiger.utm
```

The image is **copied** into `vm/macosx.qcow2`; your original is never
modified. For a `.utm` bundle, the largest disk in its `Data/` folder is
used. `--as vm/other.qcow2` imports under a different name (boot it with
`--disk`), and `--force` replaces an existing `vm/macosx.qcow2`.

The disk has to contain **PowerPC** Mac OS X. An Intel ("x86") OS X disk
won't boot on this emulated G4.

## 4. Boot

```bash
./ppcosx run
```

The first boot after an install runs the Setup Assistant (the welcome movie,
then account creation), which can take a few minutes. Then check the
acceleration: **Apple menu → About This Mac → More Info… → Graphics/Displays**
should say **ATI Radeon 9700 Pro**, with *Quartz Extreme: Supported* and
*Core Image: Supported*.

Things to know:

* **Mouse capture.** Click in the window to use the guest. **Ctrl+Option+G**
  gives the mouse back to macOS.
* **Window size.** Drag the window edge to resize it; the guest's screen
  scales to fit.
* **Shutting down.** Use **Apple menu → Shut Down** in the guest, then the
  window closes. Closing the window or pressing Cmd+Q is like pulling the
  plug: fine in an emergency, but journaled HFS+ will have to replay its
  journal next boot.
* **Something looks wrong?** Boot with `./ppcosx run --vga`. That's the plain
  framebuffer with no Radeon, useful for telling a graphics problem from
  anything else.

## 5. Next steps

* Take a snapshot of the clean install before experimenting:
  `./ppcosx snapshot save fresh-install` (with the VM shut down).
* See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for all options: memory, video memory,
  resolution, SSH forwarding, throwaway sessions and more.
* Optionally give it the real card's ROM: [ROM.md](ROM.md).
